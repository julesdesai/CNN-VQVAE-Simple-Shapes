# CNN-VQVAE-Simple-Shapes
Sandbox for VQVAE conceptual hierarchy experiments

I am investigating whether conceptual hierarchies may naturally emerge from training a VQVAE (quantised autoencoder) with a variable codebook size. Number of discrete codes are fixed to a small number, and increased according to various increment logics during training. The hypthothesis is that there may be charactersitic hierarchies in what kinds of representations are learned at which point in the codebook expansion, that may resemble human conceptual hierarchies.
